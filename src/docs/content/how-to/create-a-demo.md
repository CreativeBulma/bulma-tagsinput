# How-To
## Create a Demo
The static demo site is generated by the powerful [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. All you have ot do is to write down your demo using HTML markup language.

You can build and serve the demo site with the following shell command:
```shell
npm run demo:serve
```

The demo is now available within the `demo` directory. You can then publish the content of this directory into your webserver to provide an online demo.

{{% notification info %}}In case you distribute your template on [CreativeBulma](https://creativebulma.net), the generated demo site will be automatically used as a Preview.{{% /notification %}}
