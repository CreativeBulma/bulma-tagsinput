# [Bulma Boilerplate](https://creativebulma.net/)
The official CreativeBulma Template Boilerplate.

This project provides a starter-kit to ease your Bulma.io template development based on the last [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io) version, [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as build processor and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to provide a demo site for your template.

Create your own customized Bulma template with this well organised starter project.
